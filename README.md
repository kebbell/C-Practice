92. Write a C# Sharp program to find the next prime number of a given number. If the given number is a prime number, return the number.
From Wikipedia,
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.
Sample Output:
Original number: 120
Next prime number/Current prime number: 127
Original number: 321
Next prime number/Current prime number: 331
Original number: 43
